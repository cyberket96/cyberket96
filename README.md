# 👋 Hello, I'm CyberKET!

I’m a **Cybersecurity Enthusiast** with a **Bachelor's degree in Cybersecurity**. I’m passionate about learning and improving in the field of **Security Operations**, and **Threat Intelligence**. I’m currently exploring **Detection Engineering** and aiming to grow my skills in this area.

## 🔐 What I Do

- **Security Operations (SecOps):** 
  - I worked on monitoring and responding to security threats.
  - I helped investigate security incidents to understand and prevent future attacks.
  - I have experience with **Web Application Firewalls (WAF)** to protect websites from common attacks, like SQL injections or cross-site scripting.
  
- **Threat Intelligence:** 
  - I collect and analyze information about potential security threats to help prevent attacks.
  - I help monitor and protect against online risks, like data breaches or threats on the dark web as part of **Digital Risk Protection (DRP)** services.

- **Detection Engineering:**
  - I’m learning how to build detection rules and improve the way systems identify security threats.
